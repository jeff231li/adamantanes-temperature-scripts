# Change in Heat Capacity Upon Binding $\Delta C_{p,b}$ 

The heat capacity is obtained by taking the gradient of the enthalpy versus temperature:

$$\Delta C_{p} = \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta T}$$

There are two Jupyter Notebook in this folder:
1) [calculate_heat_capacity.ipynb](calculate_heat_capacity.ipynb) -- calculates the total change in heat capacity upon binding.
2) [calculate_heat_capacity_decomposition.ipynb](calculate_heat_capacity_decomposition.ipynb) -- calculates the change in heat capacity upon binding using the enthalpy values from the decomposition.

The numbers in the Jupyter Notebook should correspond to the values in the manuscript.
